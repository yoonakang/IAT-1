## Scanner Task
### Task Description
1. At baseline, participants were given a list of 6 [values](#values) and asked to rank them in the order of importance.
    1. Compassion and kindness	
    2. Family and friends
    3. Spirituality
    4. Power and status
    5. Wealth
    6. Fame
2. Before the scanner task, participants were guided through the demo. Those in the [control condition](#control-condition) reflected on their bottom value.
3. Scanner task description
    1. Participants in the control condition were guided through a control task ([Falk et al., 2015](#citation)) to reflect on their lowest ranked values at baseline. Participants in the control condition were presented with a series of lowest value situations pertaining to their lowest ranked value.  As a within-subjects comparison to facilitate fMRI analysis, they were also asked to imagine value-neutral everyday activities (e.g., imagine a situation when they would: “Check the weather to see the forecast”). 

    2. Forty situations (20 value, 20 everyday activity) were presented across two runs (20 in each run) in a randomized order.  Each block consisted of an initial screen showing the block type (value/everyday activity; 2s), followed by the situation description (10s) and importance rating (4s; “Indicate how important each statement is to you, 1=not very important-4=very important”).  Blocks were separated by fixation rest periods (3s); every fifth block contained a longer (10s) block of rest.
    3. For the full list of stimuli, see [control_stimuli.csv](https://github.com/cnlab/IAT/blob/master/tasks/control%20task/control_stimuli.csv)

### Control condition

``“The next task is called “Future Task.” In this task you will think about either [VALUE] or everyday activities. Earlier, you said this is NOT an important value for you. Correct?”``

(If they say no, have them rank the value in the order of importance again. Use the top value and start again.) 

``“Now, think of an example activity you can do in the future that is about [VALUE] even though this may not be important to you.”``

(Make sure they think of these activities before moving on.)

``“Now can you tell me why this is about [VALUE PHRASE]?”``

(Make sure they respond.)

``“Great, now remember what you just did because you will be doing this kind of activity in the scanner.”``

(Show them the demo slides as you explain)

``“In this task, first you will see a phrase that describes either [VALUE] or an everyday activity.”``

``“When you see “[VALUE]”, you will then see an activity that is about this value.”``

(fame example screen 2) 

<img src="https://github.com/prateekshitcnlab/PhysicalActivity2/blob/master/tasks/affirmation%20task/imgs/8.jpg" width=300>

``“When you see this, first, think of situations in the future when you might do this activity EVEN THOUGH this may not be important to you. Try and REALLY visualize yourself in this experience and think of specific details.”``

``“Can you tell me the situation in the future you may [####] even though this may not be important to you?”``

Make sure they explained the situation and why.

(fame example screen 3) 

<img src="https://github.com/prateekshitcnlab/PhysicalActivity2/blob/master/tasks/affirmation%20task/imgs/9.jpg" width=300>

``“Great, next it will ask you to indicate how important it is for you to do this activity. Please respond by using your button box. Can you tell me how important it is on the scale of 1-4?”``

When they indicate the importance,

``“OK, then please go ahead and press the button ##. Does this make sense so far? Any questions?”``

(daily activity example screen 1)

``“Sometimes you will see “Daily Activity.” “``

(daily activity example screen 2)

<img src="https://github.com/prateekshitcnlab/PhysicalActivity2/blob/master/tasks/affirmation%20task/imgs/5.jpg" width=300>

``“Then you will see an example activity that people do in daily life. Here think of situations in the future when you might do this activity. Again, really visualize and think about specific details.”``

Make sure they explained the situation and how important.

(daily activity example screen 3)

``“Next, using the button box, please indicate how important this activity is to you. (1=not very important – 4=very important)”``

``“Also in this task, the fixation screen may be sometimes longer. If you see a long fixation screen, simply relax and rest for about 10 seconds.”``
